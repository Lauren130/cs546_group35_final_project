# cs546_group35_final_project
Final Project for cs546 developing a complete web application. For this project, we plan to implement a service that allows users (Stevens students) to review professors after taking their course! Participants will be able to review the professor and future students will be able to obtain an accurate representation of course requirements/expectations.
